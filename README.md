# swarm-env

swarm-env is a starter kit for Docker Swarm monitoring with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/),
[Grafana](http://grafana.org/),
[cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor),
[Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter),
[Alert Manager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager)

Inspired by https://github.com/stefanprodan/swarmprom & https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockerprom

## Install

Clone this repository and run the monitoring stack:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AlexeySetevoi/swarm-env.git
$ cd swarm-env

ADMIN_USER=admin \
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
SLACK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/TOKEN \
SLACK_CHANNEL=devops-alerts \
SLACK_USER=alertmanager \
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mon
```

Prerequisites:

* Docker CE
* Swarm cluster with one manager and a worker node

Services:

* prometheus (metrics database) `http://<swarm-ip>:9090`
* grafana (visualize metrics) `http://<swarm-ip>:3000`
* node-exporter (host metrics collector)
* cadvisor (containers metrics collector)
* alertmanager (alerts dispatcher) `http://<swarm-ip>:9093`

## Setup Grafana

Navigate to `http://<swarm-ip>:3000` and login with user ***admin*** password ***admin***.
You can change the credentials in the compose file or
by supplying the `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables at stack deploy.

swarm-env Grafana is preconfigured with two dashboards and Prometheus as the default data source:

* Name: Prometheus
* Type: Prometheus
* Url: http://prometheus:9090
* Access: proxy

After you login, click on the home drop down, in the left upper corner and you'll see the dashboards there.

***Docker Swarm Nodes Dashboard***

URL: `http://<swarm-ip>:3000/dashboard/db/docker-swarm-nodes`

This dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring the resource usage of your Swarm nodes and can be filtered by node ID:

* Cluster up-time, number of nodes, number of CPUs, CPU idle gauge
* System load average graph, CPU usage graph by node
* Total memory, available memory gouge, total disk space and available storage gouge
* Memory usage graph by node (used and cached)
* I/O usage graph (read and write Bps)
* IOPS usage (read and write operation per second) and CPU IOWait
* Running containers graph by Swarm service and node
* Network usage graph (inbound Bps, outbound Bps)
* Nodes list (instance, node ID, node name)

***Docker Swarm Services Dashboard***

URL: `http://<swarm-ip>:3000/dashboard/db/docker-swarm-services`

This dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring the resource usage of your Swarm stacks and services, can be filtered by node ID:

* Number of nodes, stacks, services and running container
* Swarm tasks graph by service name
* Health check graph (total health checks and failed checks)
* CPU usage graph by service and by container (top 10)
* Memory usage graph by service and by container (top 10)
* Network usage graph by service (received and transmitted)
* Cluster network traffic and IOPS graphs
* Docker engine container and network actions by node
* Docker engine list (version, node id, OS, kernel, graph driver)

***Prometheus Stats Dashboard***

URL: `http://<swarm-ip>:3000/dashboard/db/prometheus`

* Uptime, local storage memory chunks and series
* CPU usage graph
* Memory usage graph
* Chunks to persist and persistence urgency graphs
* Chunks ops and checkpoint duration graphs
* Target scrapes, rule evaluation duration, samples ingested rate and scrape duration graphs
